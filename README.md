Hello!  
My name is Sam and I'm a third year at Wake Tech.  
This is my school account and I will be keeping all my future assignments in this folder.  
# About Me
## My Interests
 I enjoy skateboarding and am sponsored by _Jinx Skateboarding_. In my freetime, I like to play guitar, go out with my friends, and play video games every now and again.
## Websites I Recommend
- [Jinx Website] (https://jinxskate.myshopify.com/) - This is the website where you can buy our skateboards and merch. Our affiliates make sure our boards are made of the top notch wood and our clothes are good for both skating and lounging.
